# Voyager_Travel_Application

***Abstract***
Voyager is a social media/ travel application that is designed to revolutionize the way people document and cherish their travel experiences. In a world where global exploration has become increasingly accessible, Voyager aims to be the go-to platform for travelers seeking a seamless and memorable way to capture their journeys. The primary task was to create a user-friendly interface that effortlessly combines itinerary planning, photo journaling, and social connectivity.
The project attempts to accomplish  its goals by offering users an intuitive platform that allows them to plan and share their trips, capture moments through photos and notes, and connect with fellow travelers. Voyager goes beyond conventional travel apps by focusing on the emotional aspect of travel, emphasizing the significance of capturing and preserving special memories. Through features like personalized travel timelines and collaborative trip planning, Voyager fosters a sense of community among users, turning solo adventures into shared experiences. The broader context of Voyager lies in addressing the evolving needs of modern travelers who seek not only practical travel solutions but also a means to curate and relive the emotional tapestry of their journeys. With Voyager, the journey becomes as memorable as the destination itself, making it an indispensable companion for globetrotters around the world.


Decision Making: 

***Appwrite***
This database tool allows an end-to-end backend server for Web, Mobile, Native, or Backend apps packaged as a set of Docker microservices.
Appwrite abstracts the complexity and repetitiveness required to build a modern backend API from scratch and allows you to build secure apps faster. The goal for Appwrite is to establish one of the most secure encryptions for the back end as 
Voyager may be released to the general public. 

***Vite.js***
Vite allows for the pre-establishment of templates to occur. 

***Tailwind CSS***
Tailwind serves as a Utility-first CSS framework that is packed with classes. It does not have a predefined class for elements, such as buttons, which allows for there to be more customization.
